## Setup

Download and install node.js from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
It is a javascript runtime environment for your computer.

Download this code either using `git` or this [link](https://github.com/kcollinssibley/txter/archive/master.zip).

**NOTE**: If downloading without using `git`, it will be more difficult to get
updates versions of the application, but we can cross that bridge when we get
to it.

### Mac & Linux

Open a terminal and navigate to where you saved this code using `cd`.
